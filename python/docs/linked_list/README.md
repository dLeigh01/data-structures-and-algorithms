# Singly Linked List

This challenge is designed to learn how to create an effective linked list with basic search functionality.

## Challenge

Create classes Node and LinkedList which have the ability to create a node and linked list respectively
and run a string method to retrieve a list of all node values as well as check if a specific value is
included, check what the value of head is, and insert a new node.

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach I took for this was to have the most efficient code possible. In terms of inserting a node,
the time is O(1) because it doesn't matter how long the list is or how large the data being passed in is,
it will always have the same number of steps. I believe for the rest of this the time and space will be O(N)
because nothing is recursive, but it also will scale with the amount of data being passed in.
